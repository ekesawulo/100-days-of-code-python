# 🐍 100 Days of Code: Python

This repository contains my personal progress through [Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2024](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).


I decided to take this course as part of my cyber security journey as I only previously had basic knowledge of python. The course covers Python through various daily coding projects.

## 📆 Challenge Structure

- 📁 Each day has its own folder: `Day001`, `Day002`, ..., `Day100`
- 🧠 Each folder includes:
  - `main.py`: Python scripts for the day
  - Additional files as needed (e.g., images, JSON, HTML)
