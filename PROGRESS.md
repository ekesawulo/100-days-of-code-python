# üóìÔ∏è 100 Days of Code: Progress Log

This is my personal log for the [100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). I'll update this file daily (or weekly) to reflect completed days, challenges, and personal insights. 

## DAY 1-15:
- Relatively easy, applied previous JS knowledge, plus templates were given through the PyCharm course

## DAY 16:
- Started with OOP, was a bit confusing initially
- Remodelled coffee machine project
